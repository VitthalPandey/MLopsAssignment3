# MLOps Assignment 3

This project shows how to build a full machine learning pipeline that runs automatically.

We:
- Train a machine learning model
- Put it inside a Docker container
- Set up GitHub Actions to train and test it automatically
- Then convert the model to a smaller size using quantization

### 1. Model Training (`dev` branch)
- Used the **California Housing dataset**
- Trained a **Linear Regression model**
- Saved the model as `model.joblib`

### 2. Docker + CI/CD (`docker_ci` branch)
- Created a **Dockerfile**
- Wrote a script `predict.py` to test the model
- Set up **GitHub Actions** so that:
  - When code is pushed, it trains the model
  - Builds a Docker image
  - Tests the image automatically
  - Pushes it to DockerHub

### 3. Quantization (`quantization` branch)
- Loaded the trained model
- Compressed the model using **manual 8-bit quantization**
- Built the same model in **PyTorch**
- Tested the new model to check accuracy
